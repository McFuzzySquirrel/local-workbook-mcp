## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - MVP critical path
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (extends conversation capabilities)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (can run in parallel with US2)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (can run in parallel with US2/US3)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (can run in parallel with US2/US3/US4)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - MVP)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Extends US1 conversation features - Requires US1 core components but is independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Extends US1 data analysis - Requires US1 plugins but is independently testable, can run parallel with US2
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Extends US1 data retrieval - Requires US1 plugins but is independently testable, can run parallel with US2/US3
- **User Story 5 (P4)**: Extends US1 with export - Requires US1 conversation manager but is independently testable, can run parallel with others

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 Critical Path**:
1. Models (T008-T016) must complete before services can be implemented
2. Interfaces (T021-T023) must exist before implementations
3. Plugins (T028-T039) must exist before agent service can invoke them
4. ResponseFormatter (T040-T043) must exist before agent service can format responses
5. ConversationManager (T044-T049) must exist before agent service can manage history
6. ExcelAgentService (T050-T058) must complete before UI components can use it
7. UI Components (T062-T077) can mostly run in parallel after agent service ready
8. Validation (T078-T084) runs after all implementation complete

**Other User Stories**:
- Build incrementally on User Story 1 foundation
- Enhance existing components rather than creating new ones
- Each story should be completable and testable independently

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 - Setup**: All tasks (T001-T007) can run in parallel (different files, independent operations)

**Phase 2 - Foundational**:
- All Models (T008-T016) can run in parallel
- All Options (T017-T018) can run in parallel
- Logging tasks (T019-T020) can run in parallel
- Interface definitions (T021-T023) can run in parallel
- Program.cs updates (T024-T027) must be sequential (same file)

**Phase 3 - User Story 1**:
- Plugin creation (T028, T032, T035) can run in parallel (different files)
- Plugin method implementations within same plugin must be sequential (same file)
- ResponseFormatter and ConversationManager implementations can run in parallel (different files)
- UI component creation (T062, T064, T066, T068, T069, T076) can run in parallel (different razor files)

**Phase 4-7 - User Stories 2-5**:
- After User Story 1 complete, all remaining user stories can run in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Each story touches different methods/components
- US2 touches prompts, US3 touches plugins, US4 touches filtering, US5 adds export service

**Phase 8 - Polish**:
- Documentation tasks (T126-T128) can run in parallel
- Performance tasks (T132-T134) can run in parallel
- Security audits (T135-T137) can run in parallel
- Final validation (T138-T141) should run sequentially

2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - all models, interfaces, base services)
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Workbook Querying - full MVP)
4. üéØ **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with sample workbooks
5. üì¶ **Deploy/Demo MVP** if ready (this is shippable!)
6. Proceed to Phase 4+ based on priority

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready ‚úÖ
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) üéØ
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (better conversations)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (cross-sheet insights)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (advanced filtering)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (export capabilities)
7. Polish (Phase 8) ‚Üí Final release

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories!

### Parallel Team Strategy (If Multiple Developers)

With multiple developers:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational done:
   - Lead Developer: User Story 1 (MVP critical path)
   - Other developers: Prepare tests, documentation, infrastructure
3. **Week 4**: After User Story 1 validated:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Multi-Turn Context)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Cross-Sheet Insights)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Data Filtering)
   - Developer D: User Story 5 (Export)
4. **Week 5**: Integration testing, polish, final validation

Stories complete and integrate independently!

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks (Need Extra Attention)

- **T054-T056**: `ProcessQueryAsync` implementation - Core agent logic, many failure modes, complex error handling
- **T029-T038**: Plugin implementations - Must correctly wrap MCP tools, handle all error cases
- **T041**: HTML table formatting - Security risk (XSS) if not properly escaping cell values
- **T043**: Error sanitization - Privacy risk if sensitive data leaks into error messages
- **T072**: Query submission handler - Must handle timeouts, cancellation, errors gracefully

### Critical Validation Points

- After T027: Verify all DI registrations correct before proceeding to user stories
- After T039: Verify all plugins working with MCP server using simple test queries
- After T058: Verify agent service can successfully process query end-to-end
- After T077: Verify complete UI rendering with real workbook data
- After T084: Verify all User Story 1 acceptance scenarios pass (this is MVP gate!)

### Fallback Plans

- If Semantic Kernel integration proves problematic ‚Üí Simplify to direct OpenAI API calls with manual tool routing
- If LLM function calling unreliable ‚Üí Fall back to prompt-based tool selection with regex parsing
- If HTML table rendering performance poor ‚Üí Switch to virtualized/paginated table component
- If 20-turn context window insufficient ‚Üí Make configurable in ConversationOptions

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be **independently completable and testable**
- **Test-first development**: For production code, write tests before implementation (not included in this task list per spec)
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each completed task or logical group of related tasks
- **Stop at checkpoints** to validate story independently before proceeding
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same-file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Constitution compliance**: Verify Privacy-First (no data transmission), MCP Protocol (use existing tools), SK Integration (proper plugin patterns), Self-Contained Deployment (all local)

## Success Metrics (From spec.md)

Track progress against these success criteria:

- **SC-001**: Workbook load < 5 seconds for 50MB files
- **SC-002**: Basic queries < 10 seconds response time
- **SC-003**: 90% accuracy on structure queries
- **SC-004**: 95% accuracy on data retrieval
- **SC-005**: Complete workflow in < 3 minutes
- **SC-006**: Handle 100 sheets, 100k rows without crashing
- **SC-007**: 80% users complete first query without help
- **SC-008**: Context maintained across 5+ consecutive queries
- **SC-009**: 100% of common failures have helpful error messages
- **SC-010**: Runs on 8GB RAM, standard CPU, no GPU required

Validate these metrics after completing User Story 1 (MVP) and again after all user stories complete.
