# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Excel Conversational Agent

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - All quality checks passed  
**Validated**: October 22, 2025  
**Result**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

### Validation Notes

- All 20 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- 5 user stories properly prioritized (P1-P4) with independent test criteria
- 10 success criteria include measurable metrics and are technology-agnostic
- 9 edge cases identified covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Assumptions and dependencies clearly documented
- No implementation details in requirements (properly separated in Assumptions/Dependencies sections)
- Scope is well-bounded with clear constraints

## Notes

- Specification is production-ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and actionable
