## Key Messaging Changes

### Before
```
Status: Production-ready CLI, experimental web UI
Components: Production-ready vs Under Development
```

### After
```
Status: Work in progress - CLI stable, web chat needs validation
Components: Core backend (stable), User interfaces (WIP)
  - CLI Agent (Recommended - Well Tested ✅)
  - Web Chat (Functional - Needs Validation ⚠️)
```

**Why:** More accurate! Web chat IS functional but hasn't been extensively tested yet.

## Next Documentation Tasks

### Immediate (When Web Chat Validated)
1. Update status from "needs validation" to "stable"
2. Remove ⚠️ warnings
3. Promote web chat to recommended

### Short Term
1. Create CHANGELOG.md (version history)
2. Document deployment steps
3. Add architecture diagrams

### Medium Term
1. Create ContributingGuide.md
2. Reorganize docs/ by audience
3. Add more examples and screenshots

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be honest about status** - "Work in progress" is better than false "production-ready"
2. **Archive, don't delete** - Old docs provide history
3. **One source of truth** - GETTING-BACK-ON-TRACK.md is now current status
4. **User-first language** - Clear icons (✅ ⚠️) help users decide

---

**Documentation is now aligned with reality!** ✅
