## Quick Start

### Create the workbooks:
```pwsh
pwsh -File scripts/create-sample-workbooks.ps1
```

### Test with the CLI agent:
```pwsh
# Start with ProjectTracking
dotnet run --project src/ExcelMcp.SkAgent -- --workbook test-data/ProjectTracking.xlsx

# Inside the agent, switch between workbooks:
> load test-data/EmployeeDirectory.xlsx
> load test-data/BudgetTracker.xlsx
```

### Test workbook switching:
```
[ProjectTracking.xlsx | gpt-4] > what tasks are high priority?
... (shows tasks) ...

[ProjectTracking.xlsx | gpt-4] > load test-data/EmployeeDirectory.xlsx
‚úì Loaded workbook: EmployeeDirectory.xlsx

[EmployeeDirectory.xlsx | gpt-4] > who works in Engineering?
... (shows employees) ...

[EmployeeDirectory.xlsx | gpt-4] > switch
Enter path to new workbook: test-data/BudgetTracker.xlsx
‚úì Loaded workbook: BudgetTracker.xlsx

[BudgetTracker.xlsx | gpt-4] > what's the total income?
... (calculates income) ...
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Basic Queries:
1. **List structure**: "what tables exist?" 
2. **Search**: "show me all laptop sales" (in original sample-workbook.xlsx)
3. **Preview**: "show me the first 5 rows of TasksTable"
4. **Summary**: "summarize this workbook"

### Test Calculations:
1. "what's the total budget for all projects?"
2. "calculate total expenses in October"
3. "what's the average salary in Engineering?"
4. "how many hours were logged total?"

### Test Filtering:
1. "show me only high priority tasks"
2. "which employees earn over $80,000?"
3. "what expenses are categorized as Software?"

### Test Multi-Table Analysis:
1. "which project has the most time logged?"
2. "how many employees are in each department and what's their total salary?"
3. "compare income vs expenses by category"

### Watch for:
- ‚úÖ **Tool calls in debug log** - Should show `preview_table` or `search`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Correct calculations** - Model should use actual data, not fabricate
- ‚úÖ **Case-insensitive search** - "laptop" should find "Laptop"
- ‚úÖ **Empty worksheet params** - Should search across all sheets

## Original Sample Workbook

The original `sample-workbook.xlsx` is still available with:
- Sales data (laptops, mice, keyboards, etc.)
- Inventory data
- Returns data

Use it for e-commerce/retail testing scenarios.
