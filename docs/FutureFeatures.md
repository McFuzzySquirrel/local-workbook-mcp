# Future MCP Enhancements

A running list of capabilities we plan to explore as the Excel MCP evolves.

1. **Pivot table insights and refresh tooling** – surface existing pivot caches/tables, trigger refresh, extract summaries.
2. Workbook creation and safe write-back – generate new workbooks, add sheets/tables, append rows, and apply cell updates with validation/backup guardrails.
3. Worksheet and table organization helpers – add/move sheets, resize tables, manage totals rows, rename assets.
4. Advanced filtering and sorting automation – expose AutoFilter presets, custom filters, and multi-column sorting flows.
5. Bulk data ingestion pipelines – append DataTable / enumerable payloads into worksheets and resize tables automatically.
6. Styling and theming utilities – standardize fonts, number formats, borders, and apply workbook-wide themes.
7. Formula and calculation management – inject dynamic formulas, recalc chains, inspect dependencies.
8. Protection and access control – toggle worksheet/workbook protection, manage allowed edit ranges.
9. Graphic and reporting enhancements – leverage ClosedXML’s graphic engine to render charts, shapes, and branded covers.
